    <h3>Hello! </h3>
        <h4>our names are Deema, Johan, Apeq and Jordi, we are four students studying media technology at Link√∂ping University. Here we are working on a project where we will make our own Lego website. We chose task 1, which is about being able to find sets, as well as being able to click on them and see their detailed content. I hope that our website will be useful and help you find whatever you are looking for. Wether it is to find inspiration for your next build, find the missing piece in your set or just simply being curious we hope Legofindr will do the job!</h4>
